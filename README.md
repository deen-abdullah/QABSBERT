#QABSBERT

This code is for INLG 2020 paper  [Towards Generating Query to Perform Query Focused Abstractive Summarization using Pre-trained Model](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.inlg-1.11/)

Some codes are collected from the work of [Liu and Lapata](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08345)

We conducted our experiment on TITAN X GPU (GTX Machine) and later we have uploaded our work on GitHub for general use.
